# FITRS

**DISCLAIMER:** This lib is COMPLETELY experimental.

Read FITS file for astronomical use. Not all the features of the FITS standard
are supported, but the basic features are there.
See the tests for examples how to use.

Cannot write FITS file (yet).

The objective is to make a lib to manage FITS files in pure rust, with as few
dependencies as possible.
