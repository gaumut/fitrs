**DISCLAIMER:** This lib is experimental and unstable.
API changes will most probably occur.

Read/Write FITS file for astronomical use. Not all the features of the [FITS
standard](https://archive.stsci.edu/fits/fits_standard/) are supported, but the
basic features are there.

The objective is to make a lib to manage FITS files in pure rust, with as few
dependencies as possible multi-threading in mind.
